    <p>Having written a couple of posts with the <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> static site generator I wanted to start building out my site with extras such as <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> links and details about my side Projects. Trying to extend the site has proved harder that I thought it might, so I’m going to switch over to another platform for publishing. This is likely going to be based on Spring Boot which I had previously considered writing after trying <a href="http://jbake.org/">JBake</a>.</p>

<p>What I liked about Hexo originally was that I could easily publish to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> out of the box. It looked like I would only be able to publish the static output as part of a build step outside of Netlify. So I started to look around for an alternative and ended up on a site called <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a> which I think is produced by Netlify and lists out all their known Static Site Generators. Turns out there were plenty of Java based generators. One of them, called <a href="https://javaeden.github.io/Orchid/latest/OrchidCore/">Orchid</a>, had a <strong>Deploy to Netlify</strong> badge indicating that a Java project might be supported by Netlify, if not offically documented or easily found.</p>

<p>The starter project that you can deploy to Netlify is available through the github repo <a href="https://github.com/JavaEden/OrchidStarter">JavaEden/OrchidStarter</a>. The process of deploying to Netlify was simple and the deployment uses the gradle wrapper to download and execute the build step for Orchid.</p>

<p>My preference is to use Maven over Gradle so I investigated the possibility of using maven to generate the site and have that deployed on Netlify.</p>

<p>Starting with a standard maven project</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mvn -B archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
  -DgroupId=com.robintegg.blog \
  -DartifactId=netlify-upload
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Influenced by the Gradle Wrapper, there is a [Maven Wrapper](mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper) available. The wrapper can be added using the maven task</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Windows Users </strong>Be aware that the `./mvnw` command needs to retain it’s executable state when being deployed to GitHub so that it can be executed by Netlify. The <a href="http://blog.lesc.se/2011/11/how-to-change-file-premissions-in-git.html">Lennart Schedin blog</a> provides details and explanations on how to do this. The commands for changing the permissions are summarized below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;git ls-tree HEAD100644 blob 55c0287d4ef21f15b97eb1f107451b88b479bffe mvnw
&gt;git update-index --chmod=+x .mvnw
&gt;git status&gt;git commit -m "Changing file permissions"
&gt;git ls-tree HEAD100755 blob 55c0287d4ef21f15b97eb1f107451b88b479bffe   mvnw
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For supporting the Netlify deployment, you can add the optional <strong>netlify.toml</strong> which will override any deploy settings you might have set in the UI.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[build]  base    = ""  publish = "target/site"  command = "./mvnw clean site"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, you can publish to Github and deploy the project through Netlify.</p>

<p>My finished Github repo <a href="https://github.com/teggr/netlify-upload">teggr/netlify-upload</a> and is was automatically deployed to <a href="https://compassionate-easley-929b6f.netlify.com">https://compassionate-easley-929b6f.netlify.com</a>.</p>
