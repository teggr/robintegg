title: Software Engineering Radio - the podcast for professional software developers
subtitle: Software Engineering Radio is a podcast targeted at the professional software developer. The goal is to be a lasting educational resource, not a newscast. SE Radio covers all topics software engineering. Episodes are either tutorials on a specific topic, or an interview with a well-known character from the software engineering world. All SE Radio episodes are original content — we do not record conferences or talks given in other venues. SE Radio is brought to you by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Software magazine.
