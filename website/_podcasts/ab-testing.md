title: AB Testing
subtitle: Alan and Brent talk about Modern Testing (which isn't all that modern, and not really about testing - except when it is). Every other week or so, A&B tell stories and discuss what's happening in the world of software - including a variety of topics like Agile, Lean, Delivery, DevOps, Data Science, Experimentation, Leadership, and more.
