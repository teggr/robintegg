I've reviewed my [podcast subscriptions](/podcasts) to reflect what's currently delivering me the most back for my buck. The [published list is on Pocket Casts](https://lists.pocketcasts.com/60ff4a25-0374-40f6-906d-92a8ea884b10), which is my current podcatcher of choice.

## Managing Podcast Overload

Over the past few years, the number of high-quality tech podcasts has exploded across audio and youtube. While this is fantastic for our industry, it's become increasingly difficult to keep up with everything. I've found myself with an ever-growing backlog and the constant pressure of trying to "stay current" with dozens of feeds.

I've needed to reduce my selection due to time constraints and the sheer volume of content being generated and published. It's hard to keep up, and I'm curious—how do others manage their podcast consumption? Do you listen at 2x speed? Schedule dedicated listening time? Be ruthless about skipping episodes? I'd love to hear your strategies.

For now, I'm focusing on podcasts that provide the most value for my current interests and professional development, accepting that I simply can't listen to everything.

## My favorite Podcasts

**[REWORK](https://37signals.com/podcast)** - A podcast by 37signals about the better way to work and run your business. The REWORK podcast features the co-founders of 37signals (the makers of Basecamp and HEY), Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson sharing their unique perspective on business and entrepreneurship along with host Kimberly Rhodes.

I really enjoy REWORK because it offers unconventional and practical advice on productivity, entrepreneurship, and running a business. Jason and David's insights challenge traditional business norms and provide actionable ideas that I can apply to my own projects and work life.

**[Tech Lead Journal](https://techleadjournal.dev)** - Great technical leadership requires more than just great coding skills. It requires a variety of other skills that are not well-defined, and they are not something that we can fully learn in any school or book. Hear from experienced technical leaders sharing their journey and philosophy for building great technical teams and achieving technical excellence.

Tech Lead Journal is a must-listen for me as it dives deep into the nuances of technical leadership. Henry Suryawirawan's interviews with experienced leaders provide valuable lessons on building teams, fostering excellence, and navigating the challenges of leading in software engineering—topics that are directly relevant to my role and growth.

**[Thoughtworks Technology Podcast](https://www.thoughtworks.com/podcasts)** - The Thoughtworks podcast plunges deep into the latest tech topics that have captured our imagination. Join our panel of senior technologists to explore the most important trends in tech today, get frontline insights into our work developing cutting-edge tech and hear more about how today's tech megatrends will impact you.

I find the Thoughtworks Technology Podcast incredibly insightful for staying ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. Their discussions on innovation, software development trends, and the impact of emerging technologies keep me informed and inspired, often sparking new ideas for my own work and projects.
