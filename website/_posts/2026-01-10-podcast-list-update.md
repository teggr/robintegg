I've updated my [podcast list](/podcasts) to reflect what I'm currently following. You can also view the [published list on Pocket Casts](https://lists.pocketcasts.com/60ff4a25-0374-40f6-906d-92a8ea884b10).

## Managing Podcast Overload

Over the past few years, the number of high-quality tech podcasts has exploded. While this is fantastic for our industry, it's become increasingly difficult to keep up with everything. I've found myself with an ever-growing backlog and the constant pressure of trying to "stay current" with dozens of feeds.

I've needed to reduce my selection due to time constraints and the sheer volume of content being generated and published. It's hard to keep up, and I'm curious—how do others manage their podcast consumption? Do you listen at 2x speed? Schedule dedicated listening time? Be ruthless about skipping episodes? I'd love to hear your strategies.

For now, I'm focusing on podcasts that provide the most value for my current interests and professional development, accepting that I simply can't listen to everything.
