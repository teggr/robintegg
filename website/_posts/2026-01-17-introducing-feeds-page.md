I'm pleased to announce a new addition to this site: a [Feeds page](/feeds) that lists the RSS feeds I'm currently subscribed to. It's a simple, searchable collection of blogs, news sites, and resources that I find valuable.

## Why RSS Feeds Still Matter

In an era dominated by algorithmic timelines and recommendation engines, RSS feeds represent something increasingly rare: a way to consume content on your own terms. When you subscribe to an RSS feed, you're making a deliberate choice about what you want to read. The content comes to you in chronological order, without being filtered, ranked, or manipulated by an algorithm trying to maximize engagement.

RSS feeds give you control. You decide what sources to follow, when to read them, and how to organize them. There's no infinite scroll designed to keep you hooked, no sponsored content masquerading as recommendations, and no algorithmic interference deciding what you should and shouldn't see.

## The Value of Curated Sources

The feeds I've listed represent sources that consistently deliver value. They're not chosen by an algorithm based on engagement metrics or advertising dollars—they're chosen by me, based on the quality and relevance of their content to my interests and professional development.

This curation is intentional. Rather than trying to follow everything, I've focused on sources that provide the most insight and value. It's about quality over quantity, signal over noise.

## Taking It Further

The [Feeds page](/feeds) includes a simple search function, making it easy to find feeds by name, description, or topic. Each feed entry includes:

- **Thumbnail**: Visual identification of the source
- **Description**: What the feed covers and why it's valuable
- **Links**: Direct access to both the website and the RSS feed itself
- **Tags**: Topics and categories for easy browsing

Feel free to explore the [feeds I'm following](/feeds). You might discover some valuable sources you weren't aware of, or you might be inspired to curate your own collection.

## The Bigger Picture

RSS feeds are part of a broader movement toward more intentional, less algorithmic consumption of information. They're a reminder that the web doesn't have to be dominated by walled gardens and engagement-optimized platforms. You can still choose your own sources, read at your own pace, and maintain control over your information diet.

In a world where so much of what we see online is shaped by algorithms we don't control and can't understand, RSS feeds are a small act of digital independence. They put you back in the driver's seat.

Check out my [Feeds page](/feeds) and consider building your own collection. Your future self will thank you.
