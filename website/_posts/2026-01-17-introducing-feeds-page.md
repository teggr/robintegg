I'm pleased to announce a new addition to this site: a [Feeds page](/feeds) that lists the RSS feeds I'm currently subscribed to. It's a simple, searchable collection of blogs, news sites, and resources that I find valuable.

## Why RSS Feeds Still Matter

RSS feeds offer something rare in today's web: direct access to content without algorithmic interference. When you subscribe to a feed, you choose exactly what you want to read. The content arrives in chronological order—no ranking, no filtering, no engagement optimization.

You're in control. You pick your sources, read at your pace, and organize your subscriptions however you like. No algorithmic recommendations, no infinite scroll mechanics, no sponsored posts disguised as content.

## The Value of Curated Sources

The feeds I've listed represent sources that consistently deliver value. They're not chosen by an algorithm based on engagement metrics or advertising dollars—they're chosen by me, based on the quality and relevance of their content to my interests and professional development.

This curation is intentional. Rather than trying to follow everything, I've focused on sources that provide the most insight and value. It's about quality over quantity, signal over noise.

## Taking It Further

The [Feeds page](/feeds) includes a simple search function, making it easy to find feeds by name, description, or topic. Each feed entry includes:

- **Thumbnail**: Visual identification of the source
- **Description**: What the feed covers and why it's valuable
- **Links**: Direct access to both the website and the RSS feed itself
- **Tags**: Topics and categories for easy browsing

Feel free to explore the [feeds I'm following](/feeds). You might discover some valuable sources you weren't aware of, or you might be inspired to curate your own collection.

Check out my [Feeds page](/feeds) and consider building your own collection of feeds. It's a small way to take back control of what you read online.
