I've finally got round (thanks copliot) to adding a new addition to this site: a [Feeds page](/feeds) that lists the RSS feeds I'm currently subscribed to. It's a simple, searchable collection of blogs, news sites, and resources that I find valuable.

## Why RSS Feeds Still Matter

RSS feeds offer something rare in today's web: direct access to content without algorithmic interference. When you subscribe to a feed, you choose exactly what you want to read. The content arrives in chronological order—no ranking, no filtering, no engagement optimization.

The feeds I've listed represent sources that consistently deliver value. They're not chosen by an algorithm based on engagement metrics or advertising dollars—they're chosen by me, based on the quality and relevance of their content to my interests and professional development.

This curation is intentional. Rather than trying to follow everything, I've focused on sources that provide the most insight and value. It's about quality over quantity, signal over noise.

## Notable Feeds

### [Foojay.io](https://foojay.io/)
"Friends of OpenJDK" is a community-driven platform for Java developers. It aggregates knowledge, tutorials, and news about the Java ecosystem from a wide variety of contributors. It's a great "one-stop shop" for keeping up with the latest in Java, from JVM updates to library releases. If you are a Java developer, this is essential reading for staying connected with the wider community.

### [Spring Blog](https://spring.io/blog)
The official source for everything Spring Framework. This is where the Spring team announces new releases, explains new features, and provides deep dives into the technology stack. For anyone building enterprise Java applications, following the Spring team directly is the best way to stay ahead of the curve and understand the direction of the framework.

### [David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)](https://world.hey.com/dhh)
The creator of Ruby on Rails and CTO of 37signals (Basecamp & HEY). While I don't strictly write Ruby, DHH's writing on software engineering culture, remote work, and business philosophy is always thought-provoking. He challenges the status quo and offers a strong, opinionated perspective that often forces you to re-evaluate your own assumptions about how we build software and run businesses.
