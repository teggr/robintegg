# Summary

This book is focussed on the design of API rather than the technical details.

The main process that is applied to the various parts of API design is the [ADDR process](https://kalele.io/adopting-an-api-design-first-approach/), broken down as Align-Define-Design-Refine.

Each chapter provides guidelines and examples for applying the ADDR process steps within those ADDR phases.

Those technical parts are discussed but usually briefly and only in the context of the particular design constraints.
